GPTL is a third-party library (TPL) for performing timing.  It is included as an optional TPL that can be built into CISM.  

To do so, one first must build the GPTL libraries, and then build CISM with the GPTL libraries linked.  

Building GPTL is completely separate from the CISM build system.  To do so, use one of the included Makefiles.  Makefile.mac is a generic build for a Mac that may require some adjusting for your system.  It could also be modified to work with a Linux machine fairly easily.

To build CISM with GPTL, add the following flag to your cmake build script:
  -D CISM_USE_GPTL_INSTRUMENTATION:BOOL=ON
