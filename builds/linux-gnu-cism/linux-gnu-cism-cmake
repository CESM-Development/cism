# cmake configuration script that works on the Linux box in Matt's office (blueskies) with GCC
# Others will need to modify the Netcdf path.
# This config script is setup to perform a parallel build with Trilinos.
#
# BUILD OPTIONS:
# The call to cmake below include several input ON/OFF switch parameters, to
# provide a simple way to select different build options.  These are:
# USE_TRILINOS -- OFF by default, set to on for builds without Trilinos
# CISM_MPI_MODE -- ON by default, only set to OFF for serial builds
# CISM_SERIAL_MODE -- OFF by default, set to ON for serial builds.
# CISM_BUILD_SIMPLE_GLIDE -- ON by default, set to OFF to not build simple_glide
# CISM_ENABLE_BISICLES -- OFF by default, set to ON to build simple_bisicles
#      Setting USE_TRILINOS to OFF will generate a much smaller executable for this build.
# CISM_BUILD_EXTRA_EXECUTABLES -- OFF by default, set to ON to build eis_glide and others
# CISM_USE_GPTL_INSTRUMENTATION -- OFF by default, set to ON to use GPTL instrumentation

# Serial Build Notes:  Setting USE_TRILINOS=ON, CISM_MPI_MODE=OFF, CISM_SERIAL_MODE=ON will
# configure for a serial build.  (Note that the openmpi compilers will be used, but act as
# pass-throughs to the underlying serial compilers in this case.  If MPI is not installed,
# set the serial compilers directly.)

# NOTE: There is currently an incompatibility between simple_bisicles and GPTL.  If
# the CISM_ENABLE_BISICLES is ON, the GPTL instrumentation is turned OFF.


# After this executes, do:
#   make -j 8
