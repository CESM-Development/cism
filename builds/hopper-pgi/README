README file for the hopper-pgi build directory.

The cmake configure file hopper-pgi-cmake can be used to build parallel versions of
simple_glide and simple_bisicles, 2 programs that are part of CISM (the Community
Ice Sheet Model).  The PGI compiler suite is used for this build.  

Build Instructions:

Do this first:
Until the seacism/CMakeLists.txt.bisicles can be tested on other platforms, to use
this configuration script, you must first cd to the seacism home directory, then:
cp CMakeLists.txt CMakeLists.txt.save
cp CMakeLists.txt.bisicles CMakeLists.txt

In the builds/hopper-pgi directory, configure for the build using:
source hopper-pgi-cmake

The configuration process should complete with a final message:
-- Build files have been written to: <my_seacism_dir>/seacism/builds/hopper-pgi

The next step is to use the make program to do the build:
make -j 8

Dependencies:
The packages this build depends on (Trilinos, BISICLES, and Chombo) have already
been built.  The paths to these packages can be found in hopper-pgi-cmake.

Testing:

simple_glide quick test:
In seacism/tests/higher-order/dome, do:
1) type dome.py, this will give a 'simple glide not found' error
2) qsub -I -V -q interactive -l mppwidth=4
3) aprun -n 4 ...hopper-config/example_drivers/simple_glide/src/simple_glide dome.9_5_2012.config


simple_bisicles quick test:
TBD.
