Scripts and .config files in this dir build the Goldberg test case for use w/ native CISM dycores (e.g. seacism) and
for use w/ the Bisicles and POP2x dycores.

To build the necessary input .config files, first execute the .py script to build the base .nc input files, e.g. ...

    ./stream-shelf.py stream-shelf.config   # build input for seacism dycore

or ...

    ./stream-shelf-pop.py stream-shelf-pop.config   # build input for pop2x / bike dycore

After this, we need to add Dan's input thickness and vel fields (as init guesses). To do this, first run the respective
.m script to build the .mat file (e.g. run 'stream_shelf.m' to build 'stream-shelf.mat' for use w/ seacism).

Next, copy the original .nc input file to a temp file, 

>  cp stream-shelf.nc temp.nc

Convert the new fields from the .mat file to a .nc file using, e.g. ...

>  ./nc_from_mat-POP.py stream-shelf-pop.config

Finally, use NCO to place the converted .mat fields into the original .nc file ...

>  ncks -A -v thk,uvel,vvel stream-shelf.nc temp.nc
>  mv temp.nc stream-shelf.nc     

This .nc file is the input file to be read in by CISM when used w/ the respective .config file
(that is 'stream-shelf.nc' and ' stream-shelf.config' vs. 'stream-shelf-pop.nc' and 'stream-shelf-pop.config')

Note that the test case does not run automatically anymore. E.g., one would need to do ...

> ./simple_glide stream-shelf.config

... to run the test case using seacism.
