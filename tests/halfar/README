Halfar Test Case
========
This directory contains Python scripts for running an experiment involving
an ice sheet with a "dome" shape on a flat base.  The time evolution of this dome shape 
using the shallow-ice approximation has an analytic solution.

To run the experiment, enter the following on a terminal command line:
* For a serial job: python halfar.py
* Parallel runs, using higher-order dycores, are still being tested at this time.

The script performs the following steps:
1. Create a netCDF input file for CISM.
2. Run CISM, generating a netCDF output file.

Input and output .nc files are written into the root level dir for this test case.

To compare the results to the analytic solution, type:
python halfar_results.py

PREREQUISITES:
* The simple_glide executable must be available to the halfar.py script.  The easiest 
to do this is to link it, e.g.:
ln -s ../../../example_drivers/simple_glide/src/simple_glide .

* In order to use the halfar.py script, you will need to have Python and one of the
following Python modules installed:
Scientific.IO.NetCDF, netCDF4, or pycdf

* To view the results use ncview or another utility for viewing netCDF files.
