========
This directory contains Python scripts for running an experiment involving
an ice sheet with a "dome" shape on a flat base.  The time evolution of this dome shape 
using the shallow-ice approximation has an analytic solution.
To run the experiment, enter the following on a terminal command line:

For a serial job: python halfar.py dome.config

Parallel runs, using higher-order dycores, are still being tested at this time.

The script performs the following three steps:
1. Create a netCDF input file for Glimmer.
2. Run Glimmer, creating a netCDF output file.

Input and output .nc files are written into the root level dir for this test case.

PREREQUISITES:
In order to use the halfar.py script, you will need to have Python and one of the
following Python modules installed:
Scientific.IO.NetCDF, netCDF4, or pycdf

To view the results use ncview or another utility for viewing netCDF files.

To compare the results to the analytic solution, type:

python halfar_results.py
